    summary: "You've been navigating financial pressure for so long that survival mode has become your default setting. And here's the thing — that's not a weakness. You've developed incredible resilience, resourcefulness, and the ability to stretch every dollar further than most people can imagine. The challenge isn't that you're bad with money. It's that your nervous system is so focused on getting through today that it's hard to plan for tomorrow.",

      "Recognizing that rest isn't laziness, it's recovery",
    ],
    growthProse: "The growth edge for Survivors is learning to shift from reactive to proactive — not because you've been doing it wrong, but because your situation is no longer demanding the same survival response it once did. The first and most important step is reducing the mental load that financial uncertainty creates, which means building even the smallest buffer between you and the next crisis. Research consistently shows that even a $500 emergency cushion dramatically changes decision-making quality. Automation becomes your ally here: when systems make small decisions for you, your bandwidth frees up for bigger thinking. The second edge is giving yourself permission to have a longer horizon — to think about next year, not just next week. That shift doesn't happen overnight, and it shouldn't. But it starts with recognizing that survival mode was a tool, not a permanent identity.",
    pennyMessage: "I see you. I know what it feels like when every dollar has a destination before it even arrives. When people say 'just save more' and you want to scream because they don't understand that there's nothing left to save. You're not here because you're broken. You're here because you're ready for something to shift — even a little. And that takes more courage than people who've never been where you are could possibly understand.",
    whatThisMeans: "The Survivor orientation doesn't come from weakness — it comes from very real experience. When money has genuinely been unpredictable, scarce, or weaponized against you, your mind does what it's supposed to do: it adapts. You learned to manage in crisis mode because crisis was real. The problem is that survival thinking doesn't automatically update when circumstances change.\n\nResearch from Harvard economists Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir found that financial scarcity — even temporarily — reduces cognitive bandwidth in measurable ways, the equivalent of losing significant mental capacity to the constant mental load of making ends meet. This isn't a personal failing. It's a documented, physiological response to resource pressure. You weren't struggling because you couldn't manage money. You were struggling because your brain was working overtime just to keep the lights on.",

    summary: "You define yourself by your ability to take care of the people you love. That's beautiful, and it comes from a deep place of caring. But somewhere along the way, providing for others became your entire identity — and your own needs got pushed to the bottom of the list. You're not selfish for wanting financial peace for yourself. In fact, taking care of yourself IS taking care of your family.",

      "Letting others contribute too — you don't have to carry everything",
    ],
    growthProse: "The work for Providers is not becoming less generous — it's learning that you cannot pour from an empty vessel, and that your financial stability is itself a form of care for the people you love. When you're financially depleted, you become more fragile, not less. Building boundaries around money is one of the hardest things for a Provider to do because it feels like withholding love. But there's a difference between being generous and being financially self-sacrificing. One comes from abundance; the other comes from fear — fear of not being needed, not being loved, or not being seen as good. Getting honest about which one is operating for you is where transformation begins.",
    pennyMessage: "I know this one personally. The guilt of spending on yourself when someone you love could use that money. The automatic 'yes' before you've even checked your own account. The way your heart physically hurts when you can't help. Your love for your people is not the problem. But love without boundaries will leave you with nothing to give. And you deserve more than empty.",
    whatThisMeans: "Providers are often some of the most generous, reliable, and deeply loved people in their families and communities. The identity of being the one who shows up, who handles it, who makes sure everyone else is okay — that identity runs deep. And it likely developed for a reason. Maybe you were relied on early, or you learned that money was how love was demonstrated, or that your worth was tied to what you could provide.\n\nThe challenge isn't the generosity itself — it's that Provider patterns often include an invisible cost: your own financial wellbeing gets consistently deprioritized. Research in behavioral economics shows that social obligations around money — family loans that become gifts, guilt-driven spending, financial enabling — are among the most powerful and least-discussed drivers of financial instability. The people you love would, in most cases, not want you to be suffering quietly to protect them.",
    realLifeScenarios: [

      { step: "Create a 'Provider Budget' — a defined, limited amount for family/friend support each month", rationale: "Giving from a defined container protects both you and the relationship. It transforms unlimited obligation into intentional generosity. That's a meaningful difference." },
      { step: "Practice the phrase: 'I can't do that right now'", rationale: "Not 'I can't afford it' — that invites negotiation. 'I can't do that right now' is complete. It's not a lie; it's a boundary. Practice saying it somewhere low-stakes first." },
      { step: "Name one financial goal that is entirely yours — not for anyone else", rationale: "Providers often can't articulate what they want for themselves. Starting with one goal, however small, begins the practice of including yourself in your own financial life." },
      { step: "Talk to a trusted person about the financial weight you carry", rationale: "Provider patterns thrive in silence. Naming the dynamic out loud — to a therapist, a friend, or a community — reduces the shame that keeps it in place." },

    ],
    growthProse: "The growth for Strivers is decoupling identity from performance — learning that you are not your net worth, and that rest is not the same as failure. This is genuinely difficult work because the Striver pattern is often reinforced by real rewards. You push, you succeed, you get validation. The cycle is self-reinforcing in the short term and quietly depleting in the long term. The invitation is to ask: what am I actually building toward, and would I recognize enough if I got there? Developing a relationship with money that's rooted in values rather than benchmarks — what kind of life do I want, not what number do I want to hit — is the reorientation that transforms achievement into genuine satisfaction.",
    pennyMessage: "You work so hard. And I bet almost no one in your life understands the pressure you put on yourself — because from the outside, it looks like you're winning. But you and I both know that the number is never enough. That there's always someone further ahead. That the finish line keeps moving. What if the thing you've been chasing isn't actually a number? What if it's permission to feel proud of where you already are?",
    whatThisMeans: "Strivers are often high-achievers who use financial success as the primary measure of their worth, their safety, or their legitimacy. The drive is real, and it's produced results. The challenge is that the goalposts keep moving — no amount of achievement produces the feeling of 'enough' for long. This isn't a personality flaw. It's a pattern rooted in what money came to mean to you, often in formative years when security, approval, or identity were tied to performance.\n\nResearch on money scripts — a framework developed by financial psychologist Dr. Brad Klontz — identifies 'money status' thinking as one of the most powerful and least examined financial belief patterns. The core belief is: my worth equals my net worth. When this belief is running quietly in the background, it means your sense of safety and self-esteem are perpetually dependent on external financial benchmarks. No amount of money fixes that because it's not actually a money problem.",

      { step: "Take one full financial rest day per month — no checking, no planning", rationale: "Strivers use financial monitoring as emotional regulation. Practice tolerating the uncertainty without reaching for the account. This builds the nervous system's capacity to trust." },

Right now, for you, safety feels like it requires active maintenance: if you stop watching, something might go wrong. But safety is actually built into what you've already created. The practice is allowing yourself to experience that safety somatically — in your body, not just in a spreadsheet. This involves gently and repeatedly doing something that feels financially risky but actually isn't: spending a small amount on something purely joyful, closing the accounts and leaving them closed, sitting with financial uncertainty for a minute longer than feels comfortable. Each time you do this and survive, your nervous system updates its threat assessment.",
    pennyMessage: "I want to tell you something that might be hard to hear: you're probably doing better than you think. I know that doesn't land easily — because the worry is real, even when the bank account says you're okay. You built these walls for a reason. Something in your history taught you that security can vanish in an instant. But those walls are also keeping out the peace you've earned. You don't have to tear them down. Just... maybe open a window.",
    whatThisMeans: "Vigilantes are typically in better financial shape than they feel. You've built discipline, maintained awareness, and created real stability — and yet the worry persists. The anxiety doesn't match the bank account, and that disconnect is exhausting and confusing. The reason is that your financial hypervigilance wasn't built from your current circumstances. It was built from earlier ones, when the threat was real and constant monitoring genuinely meant safety.\n\nAttachment research describes this pattern as an anxious relationship with money: always checking, always bracing for loss, never quite trusting that it will stay. Your nervous system learned that security is temporary and requires constant maintenance. What was once an adaptive response — monitoring to protect — has become a default state that no longer reflects your actual situation, and no longer serves you.",

That starts with tiny, contained exposure: not a full financial audit, but looking at one thing. One account. One number. Then closing it. The goal at first is just to discover that looking doesn't kill you — and that it almost always reveals something smaller than what your anxiety had constructed. Research consistently shows that financial avoidance is most effectively addressed through supported accountability: having someone walk alongside you, not judge you, and help you face what you've been hiding from. That's part of why community is so central to TACK's design.",

The fact that you answered 24 questions about money — a topic your brain has been trying to protect you from — tells me everything I need to know about your courage. We're not going to do everything at once. We're not even going to do a lot. We're going to do one thing. And then we're going to notice that you survived it. And then maybe one more thing. Sound okay?",
    whatThisMeans: "Avoidance is not laziness, irresponsibility, or not caring. It is a protective response. When financial engagement has been associated with shame, anxiety, conflict, or overwhelm — your nervous system files it under 'threatening' and develops strategies to minimize exposure. Looking away is not a choice in the deliberate sense. It's a deeply conditioned reflex.\n\nThe difficulty is that avoidance is one of the most effective short-term anxiety reducers available, which is exactly why it persists. Not opening the bill makes the anxiety go away — briefly. But the bill's power grows in the dark. The longer something financial goes unexamined, the more threatening it seems, and the more justified the avoidance feels. This cycle can run for years. You don't need willpower to break it. You need a different relationship with the fear underneath it.",

    summary: "You have a healthy, evolving relationship with money. That doesn't mean it's perfect — it means you're aware, engaged, and doing the work. You've probably been through some of the patterns described in other orientations and come out the other side. You're not 'done' — nobody is — but you're in a place where optimization and growth feel more relevant than survival or healing.",
    strengths: [
      "A grounded, functional relationship with money — rare and genuinely hard-earned",
      "Self-awareness about your own patterns and where you still want to grow",
      "The emotional regulation to engage with financial challenges without being destabilized",
      "You're in a position to build actual wealth, not just manage stress",
      "The identity of someone who handles their financial life — that's a foundation everything else is built on",

      "Continuing to grow without losing the peace you've built",

    growthProse: "Builders are ready for the next level of financial engagement: moving from stability to strategy. This means examining whether your financial systems are actually aligned with your values — not just working, but working toward something that matters to you. It means looking at wealth-building vehicles you might not have fully engaged (investment accounts, tax optimization, intentional insurance coverage). It also means examining any remaining money scripts — inherited beliefs about what wealth means, who deserves it, or what having more would say about you — that may be quietly limiting your ceiling. The growth for Builders is often less about fixing something broken and more about removing what's in the way of what's already possible.",
    pennyMessage: "Look at you. You've been doing the work — and it shows. Your relationship with money isn't perfect, because no one's is. But it's honest. It's aware. It's evolving. That didn't happen by accident. You earned this through real struggle, real reflection, and real change. I'm not here to teach you the basics. I'm here to help you go deeper, build further, and maybe help you figure out how to bring others along with you.",
    whatThisMeans: "The Builder orientation doesn't mean you've always had it figured out. Most Builders arrived here through experience — they've felt the anxiety, the scarcity, the shame, or the overwhelm, and they've developed a healthier relationship with money on the other side of it. What defines the Builder is not perfection but orientation: you're moving toward financial health with awareness and intention, rather than away from financial pain in reaction.\n\nResearch on habit formation — particularly James Clear's work on identity-based change — suggests that the most durable financial transformation happens when people shift from 'I'm trying to do better with money' to 'I'm someone who manages money well.' That identity shift is what Builders have made, consciously or not. The work at this stage is optimization: refining systems, expanding your knowledge base, and ensuring your financial life is aligned with your actual values — not just functional, but meaningful.",
    realLifeScenarios: [
      "You can look at your accounts without significant dread. You might not love everything you see, but you can look.",
      "You have at least a working understanding of your financial picture — income, rough expenses, maybe some savings — even if the details aren't perfectly organized.",
      "When financial challenges come up, your first response is usually to figure it out rather than to shut down or catastrophize.",
      "You're genuinely interested in improving — not from a place of shame, but from a place of wanting more of what financial stability makes possible.",

    nextSteps: [
      "Identify one area of your financial life that still needs attention — there's always one",
      "Consider how your experience could support someone earlier in their journey",
      "Set a growth goal that excites you, not just a maintenance goal",
    ],
    nextStepsWithRationale: [
      { step: "Audit your current financial systems: what's working, what's just 'good enough'?", rationale: "Builders sometimes tolerate fine when excellent is available. A periodic honest review — budget categories, account structures, automated savings rates — reveals the gaps that are easy to miss when nothing feels urgent." },
      { step: "Define what financial freedom actually looks like for you — specifically", rationale: "Not a number. A description: what would you do differently? What would change? This gives your optimization a destination beyond 'more.'" },
      { step: "Look at your investment situation with fresh eyes", rationale: "If you have retirement accounts you haven't reviewed in a while, contribution rates you haven't revisited, or money sitting in low-yield accounts — this is the moment. You have the stability to play offense now." },
      { step: "Examine your relationship with earning", rationale: "Builders sometimes hit income ceilings that are psychological, not practical. Beliefs about whether you deserve more, whether asking is appropriate, or whether success at a higher level is really for someone like you — these are worth looking at directly." },
      { step: "Consider what you want to pass on — financially and otherwise", rationale: "Builders are often uniquely positioned to break generational financial patterns, not just for themselves but for the people who come after them. What that looks like for you is worth defining." },
    ],
    blendCallout: {
      text: "Builders sometimes discover threads of The Vigilante (the awareness is still more anxious than grounded), The Striver (the motivation is still achievement-driven more than values-driven), or old Survivor or Avoider patterns that resurface during high-stress periods. If any of those felt partially true, that nuance is real and worth honoring.",
