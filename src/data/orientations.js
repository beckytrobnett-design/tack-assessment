  survivor: {
    id: 'survivor',
    name: 'The Survivor',
    tagline: "You know how to make a way out of no way.",
    color: '#C75B39',
    summary: "You've been navigating financial pressure for so long that survival mode has become your default setting. And here's the thing — that's not a weakness. You've developed incredible resilience, resourcefulness, and the ability to stretch every dollar further than most people can imagine. The challenge isn't that you're bad with money. It's that your nervous system is so focused on getting through today that it's hard to plan for tomorrow.",
    strengths: [
      "Incredibly resourceful — you make things work when others would give up",
      "Street-smart about money in ways that can't be taught in a classroom",
      "Resilient — you've been knocked down and gotten back up more times than you can count",
      "You understand the real value of a dollar",
    ],
    growthAreas: [
      "Building breathing room so you're not always in crisis response",
      "Allowing yourself to believe stability is possible for you",
      "Moving from surviving to choosing — one small step at a time",
      "Recognizing that rest isn't laziness, it's recovery",
    ],
    pennyMessage: "I see you. I know what it feels like when every dollar has a destination before it even arrives. When people say 'just save more' and you want to scream because they don't understand that there's nothing left to save. You're not here because you're broken. You're here because you're ready for something to shift — even a little. And that takes more courage than people who've never been where you are could possibly understand.",
    whatThisMeans: "Your Survivor orientation means your brain has been trained by real experience to prioritize immediate needs. Research shows that financial scarcity actually consumes cognitive bandwidth — it's like running a demanding app in the background of your mind 24/7. This isn't a character flaw. It's your brain doing exactly what it was designed to do under pressure. The work ahead isn't about willpower. It's about creating just enough breathing room that your brilliant mind can think beyond today.",
    nextSteps: [
      "Start with one small \"breathing room\" action — even $5 set aside counts",
      "Notice when survival mode kicks in — awareness is the first shift",
      "You don't have to fix everything at once. One thing. That's it.",
    ],
  },
  provider: {
    id: 'provider',
    name: 'The Provider',
    tagline: "Your generosity is a superpower — and it needs protecting.",
    color: '#90B4A8',
    summary: "You define yourself by your ability to take care of the people you love. That's beautiful, and it comes from a deep place of caring. But somewhere along the way, providing for others became your entire identity — and your own needs got pushed to the bottom of the list. You're not selfish for wanting financial peace for yourself. In fact, taking care of yourself IS taking care of your family.",
    strengths: [
      "Deeply generous and community-minded",
      "Reliable — people know they can count on you",
      "Motivated by love, not greed",
      "You understand that money is about people, not numbers",
    ],
    growthAreas: [
      "Learning that saying \"not right now\" isn't the same as saying \"I don't care\"",
      "Building your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs",
      "Recognizing that depleting yourself helps no one long-term",
      "Letting others contribute too — you don't have to carry everything",
    ],
    pennyMessage: "I know this one personally. The guilt of spending on yourself when someone you love could use that money. The automatic 'yes' before you've even checked your own account. The way your heart physically hurts when you can't help. Your love for your people is not the problem. But love without boundaries will leave you with nothing to give. And you deserve more than empty.",
    whatThisMeans: "Your Provider orientation means you've internalized the belief that your worth is measured by what you give. This often develops in families or cultures where sacrifice is celebrated and self-care is seen as selfish. The research shows that this pattern, while rooted in genuine love, creates a cycle where you're always depleted — which actually makes you less effective at the providing you care so much about. The transformation isn't about giving less. It's about including yourself in the circle of people you take care of.",
    nextSteps: [
      "Before your next \"yes,\" pause and ask: can I do this AND still be okay?",
      "Create one financial boundary this week — even a tiny one counts",
      "Practice saying \"let me think about it\" instead of automatic yes",
    ],
  },
  striver: {
    id: 'striver',
    name: 'The Striver',
    tagline: "Your ambition is a gift — when it serves you, not defines you.",
    color: '#1B3A52',
    summary: "You are driven, focused, and always reaching for the next level. That work ethic and ambition have gotten you far. But somewhere in the pursuit, your self-worth got tangled up with your net worth — and no amount of money ever feels like enough. The goalpost keeps moving. The real shift isn't about earning more. It's about learning that you were enough before the first dollar.",
    strengths: [
      "Incredible drive and work ethic",
      "Goal-oriented and disciplined",
      "Willing to take strategic risks",
      "You believe in your own potential — that's powerful",
    ],
    growthAreas: [
      "Separating your worth from your earnings",
      "Celebrating milestones instead of immediately chasing the next one",
      "Building a definition of \"enough\" that actually sticks",
      "Letting yourself rest without calling it laziness",
    ],
    pennyMessage: "You work so hard. And I bet almost no one in your life understands the pressure you put on yourself — because from the outside, it looks like you're winning. But you and I both know that the number is never enough. That there's always someone further ahead. That the finish line keeps moving. What if the thing you've been chasing isn't actually a number? What if it's permission to feel proud of where you already are?",
    whatThisMeans: "Your Striver orientation often develops when money represented approval, status, or proof of value in your early environment. The drive itself isn't the problem — it's that it's been hooked to your identity. Behavioral research shows that when self-worth is contingent on financial achievement, each success provides only temporary relief before the anxiety returns. You're not actually chasing money. You're chasing a feeling of being enough.",
    nextSteps: [
      "Write down three things you've accomplished that have nothing to do with money",
      "Notice when the \"not enough\" voice shows up — just notice it",
      "Practice enjoying what you have today, not just what you're building toward",
    ],
  },
  vigilante: {
    id: 'vigilante',
    name: 'The Vigilante',
    tagline: "Your watchfulness kept you safe — now it's time to let it rest.",
    color: '#D97706',
    summary: "You are disciplined, prepared, and always scanning for threats. Chances are, you're in better financial shape than most people around you — but you can't feel it. The worry doesn't match the reality anymore, but your nervous system hasn't gotten the memo. You built this hypervigilance for a reason, and it served you well. The growth now is learning to trust what you've built.",
    strengths: [
      "Financially disciplined and prepared",
      "Exceptional attention to detail",
      "Rarely caught off guard — you plan ahead",
      "You've built more security than you give yourself credit for",
    ],
    growthAreas: [
      "Allowing yourself to feel the safety you've actually created",
      "Spending on joy without guilt or fear",
      "Trusting that checking once is enough",
      "Recognizing when vigilance becomes anxiety",
    ],
    pennyMessage: "I want to tell you something that might be hard to hear: you're probably doing better than you think. I know that doesn't land easily — because the worry is real, even when the bank account says you're okay. You built these walls for a reason. Something in your history taught you that security can vanish in an instant. But those walls are also keeping out the peace you've earned. You don't have to tear them down. Just... maybe open a window.",
    whatThisMeans: "Your Vigilante orientation typically develops after experiencing financial instability, loss, or witnessing someone you love lose everything. Your brain learned that constant monitoring equals safety. The challenge is that this hypervigilance consumes enormous emotional energy and prevents you from enjoying the stability you've worked so hard to create. Attachment research shows this mirrors an anxious attachment to money — always checking, never quite trusting it will stay.",
    nextSteps: [
      "Check your accounts once today. Then close them. Practice trusting.",
      "Spend $20 on something purely joyful this week — no justification needed",
      "When the urge to check hits, take three breaths first and ask: am I safe right now?",
    ],
  },
  avoider: {
    id: 'avoider',
    name: 'The Avoider',
    tagline: "Looking away was how you protected yourself. Now you're ready to look.",
    color: '#6B7280',
    summary: "Money makes you want to change the subject, close the tab, think about literally anything else. This isn't laziness or irresponsibility — it's a freeze response. At some point, money became so overwhelming or painful that your brain decided the safest option was to not engage at all. The fact that you're here, reading this? That's already a breakthrough. You're looking. That takes guts.",
    strengths: [
      "Self-aware enough to know this is a pattern (that's huge)",
      "You're here — which means you're ready for something different",
      "Often creative and resourceful in non-financial areas of life",
      "When you do engage with money, you bring fresh perspective",
    ],
    growthAreas: [
      "Building a relationship with money that feels safe, not scary",
      "Taking one small financial action at a time — no marathons",
      "Creating systems that make money management automatic",
      "Forgiving yourself for the avoidance — it was survival",
    ],
    pennyMessage: "Hey. You're here. Do you know how big that is? Most people with your pattern never take this step. The fact that you answered 24 questions about money — a topic your brain has been trying to protect you from — tells me everything I need to know about your courage. We're not going to do everything at once. We're not even going to do a lot. We're going to do one thing. And then we're going to notice that you survived it. And then maybe one more thing. Sound okay?",
    whatThisMeans: "Your Avoider orientation is a freeze response — the same survival mechanism that causes an animal to play dead when fight or flight aren't options. Something in your experience made money feel so overwhelming, painful, or hopeless that avoidance became the only way to cope. This is not a character flaw. It's your nervous system doing its job. The path forward isn't about forcing yourself to engage. It's about making engagement feel safe enough that your brain allows it.",
    nextSteps: [
      "Your only assignment: check one account balance this week. That's it. Just look.",
      "If that feels like too much, just open the banking app. You don't even have to look at numbers.",
      "Celebrate the looking. Seriously. It matters more than you think.",
    ],
  },
  builder: {
    id: 'builder',
    name: 'The Builder',
    tagline: "You've done the work. Now let's refine it.",
    color: '#059669',
    summary: "You have a healthy, evolving relationship with money. That doesn't mean it's perfect — it means you're aware, engaged, and doing the work. You've probably been through some of the patterns described in other orientations and come out the other side. You're not 'done' — nobody is — but you're in a place where optimization and growth feel more relevant than survival or healing.",
    strengths: [
      "Self-aware and emotionally intelligent about money",
      "Balanced approach — neither avoidant nor obsessive",
      "Able to hold complexity — money can be hard AND manageable",
      "You've done real transformation work, whether you call it that or not",
    ],
    growthAreas: [
      "Continuing to grow without losing the peace you've built",
      "Sharing what you've learned with others on the journey",
      "Staying humble — the work is never fully done",
      "Building legacy and purpose beyond personal stability",
    ],
    pennyMessage: "Look at you. You've been doing the work — and it shows. Your relationship with money isn't perfect, because no one's is. But it's honest. It's aware. It's evolving. That didn't happen by accident. You earned this through real struggle, real reflection, and real change. I'm not here to teach you the basics. I'm here to help you go deeper, build further, and maybe help you figure out how to bring others along with you.",
    whatThisMeans: "Your Builder orientation reflects a readiness for a different kind of financial engagement. You've moved through the patterns that keep many people stuck and built something that works. The research shows that this awareness — this ability to see your own patterns and choose differently — is the foundation of lasting financial wellness. Your growth now is about refinement, legacy, and perhaps becoming a resource for others in your community.",
    nextSteps: [
      "Identify one area of your financial life that still needs attention — there's always one",
      "Consider how your experience could support someone earlier in their journey",
      "Set a growth goal that excites you, not just a maintenance goal",
    ],
  },
